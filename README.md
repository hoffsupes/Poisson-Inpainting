# Poisson-Inpainting

Poisson Compositing code modified to produce inpaining effects. Here the guidance vector field is set to zero.

Thereby effectingly making, Del^2[I] = 0;

Where I is the final composite image to be formed.

Coming Soon: Simple GUI to do poisson compositing which allows you to see the result realtime! A Linux executable will be made available!
